### Hi, I’m Jing 👋 
- 🎓 Ph.D. in Applied Physics / mini-MBA / math modeling teaching fellow at Harvard University
- 🔭 I’m currently working on natural language processing and machine learning
- 👀 I’m passionate about sharing! Here is a list of my [recommended courses on ML](https://runawayhorse001.github.io/PythonTipsDS/kaggle.html)
- 🌱 I’m always curious and there are so many new things to learn!
- 📝 I'm coauthor of open-sourced and free book (107 pages)-- [Python and Pyspark Tips for Data Scientist](https://github.com/runawayhorse001/PythonTipsDS)
- 😄 Fun Facts: I grew up in Jingdezhen, China, which is known as the "Porcelain Capital" for producing high quality Chinese ceramics for 1700 years. I studied cobalt material for my PhD, where cobalt oxide is the secret ingredient of blue pigment for ["Blue and white pottery"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_and_white_pottery) (Chinese: 青花; pinyin: qīng-huā; lit. 'Blue flowers/patterns') that made my hometown famous! I now live in Minneapolis - St. Paul metro area with my family.
